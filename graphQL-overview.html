    <h1>GraphQL Overview</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>GraphQL reduces the complexity of building APIs by abstracting all requests to a single endpoint</li>
        <li>Unlike traditional REST APIs, it is declarative; whatever is requested is returned</li>
        <li>Not all projects require GraphQL, GraphQL is merely a tool to consolidate data.  If we already have a stable
        RESTful API system where we rely on data from a single data source, we dont need GraphQL</li>
        <li>GraphQL has a well defined schema, so we know for sure we wont over-fetch</li>
        <li>If we have a full-fleged product that relies on data from multiple sources we should go for GraphQL</li>
    </ul>
