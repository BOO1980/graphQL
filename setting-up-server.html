<h1>Setting up our server</h1>
<ul><li>
    A GraphQL server is built on top of schema and resolvers
</li><
    <li>As a first step we build a schema, defining types, queries, mutations and subscriptions</li>
    <li>A Schema describes the whole app structure</li>
    <li>We need to build respective resolvers to compute and dispatch data </li>
    <li>A resolver maps actions with functions for each query declared in typeDef, we create a resolver to return data</li>
</ul>
